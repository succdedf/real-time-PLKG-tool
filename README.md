# real-time-PLKG-tool

First, this tool is deployed across two computers, with the codebase divided into two Git branches: ue and bs. You can switch to the corresponding branch to obtain the appropriate code for each side.
Second, the openairinterface5g directory in this project is based on the OAI (OpenAirInterface) open-source project, with some modifications made to the original code.
If you wish to deploy this tool, please first follow the https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/-/blob/2023.w45/doc/NR_SA_Tutorial_OAI_CN5G.md?ref_type=tags tutorial provided in the OAI documentation to set up OAI on both ends.
